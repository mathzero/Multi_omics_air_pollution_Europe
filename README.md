# Multi omics air pollution in Europe
Exploring the OMICs response to short and long-term exposure to air pollution at multiple molecular levels

### Background
* Data from ESCAPE cohort study 
* Large multi-centre study tracking long-term effects of environmental pollutants. 
* We have a slice of data: 164 participants in 4 European cities
* Each wore a device which measured PM25 and PNC (pollution particles) exposure for 24 hours, on 3 occasions over a year
* OMICs measurements also taken on each of the 3 days
* Background (annual) levels of air pollution exposure also modelled for each person

### Research Goals
* Investigate markers at each OMIC level associated with short term and long-term (really medium-term) exposure
* Use different methods for identifying ‘interesting’ markers. How do these methods compare?
* OMIC integration and biological interpretation
